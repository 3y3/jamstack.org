  <p>
    As usual, we kick off by looking at the demographics of our community. Who
    are we, exactly?
  </p>

  {{ permalinkHeading.render("h3", "Job titles") }}

  <p>
    There was not much change in the breakdown of reported job titles in our
    survey this year: as usual, nearly everyone (84%) who responded considers
    themselves to be an engineer of some kind. There was one curious change,
    however: the number of people calling themselves “full stack” versus “front
    end” has almost exactly flipped, from 32% full stack and 45% front end last
    year to 44% full stack and 33% front end in the 2022 survey. None of the
    other demographic markers we tracked changed very much, so we believe this
    is a real shift in how the community thinks of itself. We have two theories
    about why this might be the case, and we’ll discuss them in the sections on
    <a href="">job changes</a> and <a href="">serverless</a>.

  {{ permalinkHeading.render("h3", "Employment status") }}

  <p>
    This year when asking about employment status we added a new category,
    “self-employed”, which meant that the results are not totally comparable to
    last year. A bunch of people who last year described themselves as
    “full-time” switched to the “self-employed” category, which makes sense.
    Students continue to be the second-biggest group in the community, at 21% of
    all respondents. As we said last year, this is a solidly positive sign for a
    community: the Jamstack remains a popular way to on-board students at
    bootcamps into deploying websites for the first time, and becoming the
    “default” way to build a website means the Jamstack can expect to enjoy
    growth for years to come.

  {{ permalinkHeading.render("h3", "Working experience") }}

  <p>
    When asking about our community’s level of working experience, we saw a
    continuing trend from 2020 and 2021: the community is slowly increasing in
    experience. 2021 was our biggest year for new community members, and you can
    see that cohort moving up by 1 year of experience in this chart. In 2022,
    nearly 1 in 5 developers say they have been working in their current career
    for 15 or more years.

  {{ permalinkHeading.render("h4", "Increasing geographical diversity") }}

  <p>
    Repeating a phenomenon we first noticed last year, the geographical
    diversity of our respondents has a strong correlation to their level of
    career experience. In the most experienced group, 84% of respondents come
    from either North America or Europe. In our newest group, those with less
    than a year of experience, that falls to just 43%. That means in 2022 for
    the first time, more than half of people who joined the Jamstack community
    came from outside of the two big regions!
  </p>

  <p>
    An explanation for this correlation that we find persuasive is that access
    to technology is continuing to improve worldwide, leading to increased
    geographical diversity. We think this is an encouraging trend, and hope that
    it will lead to greater diversity in other dimensions as well.
  </p>

  {% include "./experience-by-region.njk" %}

  <p>
    Every region outside of Europe and North America grew in share. The
    fastest-growing region was Africa, which jumped from 4% of respondents to 8%
    from 2021 to 2022. This author is also delighted to note that his home
    region, the Caribbean, went from 0.5% to 1% in the same period.

  {{ permalinkHeading.render("h3", "The Great Resignation") }}

  <p>
    A phenomenon that gained a great deal of attention in 2021 was a spike in
    the number of people changing jobs, which has become known as The Great
    Resignation. We were interested to get hard numbers on the reality of this
    change, and we were not disappointed: fully two-thirds of our respondents
    reported that they changed jobs in the last year, a truly monumental shift.
    In our job titles data we saw a big change in job titles, with 11% switching
    from front-end to full-stack roles, a change that seems totally plausible in
    the context of a community where 67% of people changed jobs.
