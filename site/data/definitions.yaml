javascript: "Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is handled by JavaScript, running entirely on the client. This could be any frontend framework, library, or even vanilla JavaScript."
apis: "All server-side processes or database actions are abstracted into reusable APIs, accessed over HTTP with JavaScript. These can be custom-built or leverage third-party services."
markup: "Templated markup should be pre-built at deploy time, usually using a site generator for content sites, or a build tool for web apps.<br><br>[Want to see some examples?](/examples)"
